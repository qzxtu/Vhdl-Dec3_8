# 3-to-8 Decoder with Active-Low Enable

This VHDL code demonstrates the behavior of a 3-to-8 decoder with an active-low enable signal and positive logic. It utilizes behavioral programming using signal selection or conditional signal instructions, as discussed in class.

## Code Description

The VHDL code consists of an entity `dec3a8` and an architecture `Behavioral`. Here's a breakdown of the code functionality:

### Entity

The entity `dec3a8` defines the following ports:

- `A` (input): Enable signal, active-low
- `B` (input): 3-bit input signal representing the decoder's select lines
- `C` (output): 8-bit output signal representing the decoder's outputs

### Architecture

The architecture `Behavioral` implements the behavior of the 3-to-8 decoder. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. Declaration of internal signal: `ax` - an 8-bit vector used for intermediate calculations.
2. Using a `with-select` structure, the code assigns specific values to `ax` based on the different combinations of the 3-bit input `B`.
3. The assignments for `ax` are as follows:
   - "10000000" when B = "000"
   - "01000000" when B = "001"
   - "00100000" when B = "010"
   - "00010000" when B = "011"
   - "00001000" when B = "100"
   - "00000100" when B = "110"
   - "00000010" for all other combinations of B
4. Finally, the output signal `C` is assigned the value of `ax` when the enable signal `A` is '0'. If `A` is '1', then `C` is set to "00000000".
